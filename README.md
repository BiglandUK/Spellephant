# Spellephant
A heavy duty spelling bee program

The original idea was to create a program to help people learn spelling through a few simple games.

The program would NOT supply WRONG spellings - these would only come from the user. In effect, the user would have their own wrong spellings presented to them amongst the correct ones.

Animations would show how their wrong spelling needed to change to be made correct.

The software could identify incorrect letters, missing letters, additional letters and two letters swapped over.

Was never finished. Needs to be updated to something like SFML.

It used sqlite to store the data - could this easily be changed to use regular classes?
